    "#### Chi-Square (χ²) Test\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-square (χ²) test is a statistical method used to compare observed data with expected data under a specific model. It measures how well the observed results fit the expected distribution by evaluating the discrepancies between them. This test is mainly applied to categorical data, where the order of categories does not matter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, chi-square tests are used to determine whether:\n",
    "- The observed results align with the expected results.\n",
    "- Two categorical variables are related (dependent) or independent.\n",

    "#### Types of Chi-Square Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test of Independence \n",
    "   - Examines whether two categorical variables are related.  \n",
    "   - Example: Is there a relationship between car brand preference and gender?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Goodness-of-Fit Test\n",
    "   - Assesses how well a sample distribution matches a known or assumed population distribution.  \n",
    "   - Example: *Does a sample reflect the expected proportions in the population?*\n",

    "### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to evaluate differences between the means of three or more groups. Instead of comparing groups one by one, ANOVA allows for the simultaneous comparison of multiple group means.  \n",

    "### Two-Tailed Test\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test is not a standalone statistical test, but rather a feature of how a hypothesis test is designed. It is related to the directionality of the alternative hypothesis in tests such as the t-test or z-test.  \n",
